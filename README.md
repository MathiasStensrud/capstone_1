## Summary
  My project was to analyze data from the CDC Youth Risk Behavior Survey, and look for differences between LGBT youth's underage drinking, and their non LGBT peers.

  My hypothesis was that LGBT youth would be at a greater risk for underage drinking or usage of drugs, potentially due to various social factors.



#### EDA
  My initial EDA was promising, with close to half of LGBT students having drunk alcohol in the past 30 days, as compared to only 15% of their straight peers.
